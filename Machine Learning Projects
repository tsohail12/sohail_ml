Machine Learning - Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that involves training algorithms to learn from data, allowing them to make predictions, classify objects, or make decisions without being explicitly programmed. The goal of machine learning is to enable machines to improve their performance on a task over time, based on the data they receive.

Machine learning algorithms work by analyzing large datasets and identifying patterns, relationships, and correlations within the data. This analysis enables the algorithm to make predictions or take actions based on new, unseen data.
